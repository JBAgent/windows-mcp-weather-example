# Windows MCP Weather Example

A Windows-compatible implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Weather example for Claude Desktop integration.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a simple MCP server that provides weather functionality to Claude Desktop on Windows. The server offers two main tools:

1. **get-alerts**: Fetch weather alerts for a specified US state
2. **get-forecast**: Get a weather forecast for a specific location by latitude and longitude

This example uses the National Weather Service (NWS) API to fetch real weather data.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18 or higher
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) with MCP support
- Windows 10 or 11

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/JBAgent/windows-mcp-weather-example.git
   cd windows-mcp-weather-example
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

## Running the Weather Server with Claude Desktop

1. First, start Claude Desktop

2. Run the server (use Command Prompt or PowerShell):
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   
3. In Claude Desktop, click the puzzle piece icon (ðŸ§©) in the top-right corner to open the MCP server selector

4. Select "Add MCP Server" and enter `weather` when prompted for the server name

5. You should see confirmation that the weather server has connected successfully

## Using the Weather Tools

Once connected, you can ask Claude to use the weather tools with natural language, for example:

- "What are the current weather alerts in CA?"
- "Can you tell me the weather forecast for latitude 37.7749 and longitude -122.4194?"

## Troubleshooting Windows Issues

If you encounter issues:

1. **Path Issues**: Ensure the Node.js executable and npm are in your system's PATH variable

2. **Permission Errors**: Try running the Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator

3. **Connection Errors**: Make sure you've clicked the "Allow" button when Claude Desktop prompts for MCP permission

4. **Persistence**: The MCP permission needs to be granted each time you restart Claude Desktop

## Development

To modify the server or add new features:

1. Edit the files in the `src` directory
2. Rebuild with `npm run build`
3. Restart the server with `npm start`
